Learning Objectives
A common problem in robotics and control is path planning.
In EE 16B, we studied controllable systems from a linear-algebraic perspective. 
Our state variables (angle, position, etc) would be represented by a vector, and the system would be represented by matrix transformation. 
We used this linear system perspective as a means of controlling our robot car.

Once we have a robot under control, the next thing we want to do in a variety of scenarios is to plan out the path that our robot car should take to accomplish a certain task. 
In order to do so, we'll need to reconsider how we think about our "state"â€”rather than view a state as a vector which can take on continuous values, 
  we will instead define a set of discrete values that our variables can take on and consider the state as a node in a graph.

You'll recall from EE 16B that given a continuous-time system, we can sample or discretize in the time dimension and model some scenarios with a discrete-time system. 
Graph state-space models take another step of also discretizing in the spatial dimensions to have a finite number of possible states.
